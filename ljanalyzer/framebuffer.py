Module that provides a thread safe ring buffer that is used to store video 
frames or live stream frames.

class FrameBuffer():
    '''
    Abstraction of a ring buffer with thread safe add() and pop() methods.
    It supports simultaneous reading and writing operations. We use it in 
    combination with two threads:
        1) Read video frame by frame from file or drone stream, visualize the 
        frame and safe it to this buffer.
        
        2) Read from the same buffer and perform pose detection.
        
        
    As the write operation will likely be quicker than the pose detection 
    operation, race conditions may occur.
    That's why a conditional lock is used as synchronization primitive.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    frame_count : int
        number of frames present in video or number of frames needs to be 
        buffered when using in combination with live stream.
    frame_props : tuple
        frame size in (width, height, channels)
    lock : bool
        enable (default) or disable the synchronization.
        if disabled, you have to handle lost frames or ensure a large enough 
        buffer, so that the writing thread cannot catch up and overwrite data
        that the processing thread has not processed yet.
    
    Usage hint
    -----------
    The larger this buffer is, the quicker the writing thread will be able to 
    work.
    The ringbuffer itself takes care about not allocating too much memory. 
    
    CAUTION
    --------
    Because of synchronization the visualizing thread might be slowed down
    significantly.
    Especially for small buffer sizes, the first thread has to wait for the 
    second thread whenever it catches up.

        If synchronization is enabled, the opperation is delayed until a new 
        frame is available. In reality, this shouldn't happen too often as the
        writing thread will (always) be faster than the processing thread.
